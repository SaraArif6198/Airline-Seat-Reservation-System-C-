# ✈️ Airline Seat Reservation System (C++)

A simple console-based **Airline Seat Allocation System** built using C++ for Discrete Structures coursework. It simulates seat reservation and cancellation in a plane with 8 rows and 4 seats per row.


## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Reserve Seats** by entering seat numbers like `1A`, `4C`, etc.
- ❌ **Cancel Reservations** using format like `C1A`, `C4C`
- 🔄 Real-time **seat chart updates**
- 🧾 Tracks total reserved seats and prevents overbooking
- 📃 Uses array manipulation and logic conditions (Discrete Structures concepts)


## 🧠 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Discrete Structures Concepts:** Logical operations, matrix indexing, and state transitions
- 🧮 **Data Representation:** 2D array representing airplane seat layout (`8 x 4`)
- 🧼 **Input Parsing:** Supports input like `C3B`, `5A`, `-1` (exit)
- 🧰 **C++ Concepts:** Arrays, Strings, Loops, Conditionals, Functions


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++  
- **Platform:** Windows (uses `windows.h` and `system("cls")`)
- **Tools:** Standard I/O + basic CLI display
